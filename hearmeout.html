ok, hear me out

Central inventory system, like real city rp

Multiple differnt store systems, using the same base thing. Black market, legal market (like the shops), bookies could have a similar shop to sa-mp one where you could buy lottery ticket and shit. 

every time you buy something from said markets, the item is put into your inventory

There are no "jobs" , but employed & unemployed. 

To earn money , you can do some tasks around the map, which will render you employed. tasks like idk delivery or something. also police. 

illegal jobs can include robbing people , but for normal darkrp things like weed and shit i had a plan.

some form of black market system ok, similar to the markets above, you can buy various illegal items. You can grow weed, poppy from the black market, and its the same sort of system throughout. So no different 
shitty addons for each thing. i.e you want to grow poppy then buy poppy seed, but you can put it in the same pot as you would  grow the weed in. ya digg? 

idk what else but this is what i got in my head, im basically copying samp

BUT!!!!!!!!!!! it doesnt HAVE to be sa-mp style. i just think it would be convenient
