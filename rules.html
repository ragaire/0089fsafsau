<h3> Organised Events </h3>
 PD Raids can be organized between players. You must have at least 3 players to engage a PD raid.

 Things like Terrorist attacks , kidnappings , Hostage taking, ARE ALLOWED as long as its well planned out, and doesnt involve aimlessly killing people for absolutely no reason. You must have an agenda behind your attack, a backstory. Once it is not a random attack its allowed. Do not repeatedly be a terrorist. 10-15 minutes is required before you carry out another attack.

<h3> Raids </h3>
 While you are raiding a base, you may kill anyone within the confines of the base. If raiding is a result of a warrant, you may only arrest everyone within the confines.

 A raidable is anything that can be used or sold to make money. 

 If it is apparent that no valuables are in a base, you can not raid the base.

 You cannot steal items vital to fulfilling a job (printers, cigs machine etc.), doing so is considered a fail raid. However, you may destroy them.

 You must wait 10 minutes after finishing a raid on a base to raid that same base again.

 Raids can only last up to 5 minutes, so once the raid timer expires all raiders must leave the base.

 If you die while raiding a base, you can not return to that base to continue raiding or to assist other raiders until 10 minutes have passed.

 If all raiders die, the raid is over and the 10 minute cooldown begins before you can raid that same base again.

 No building or locking doors is allowed during a raid.

 You cannot change job during a raid


<h3> Kidnapping </h3>
 Don't kidnap someone and hold them forever. 10 Minutes maximum

 Dont kidnap the same person repeatedly.


<h3> Mugging </h3>
 There is no max mugging price, but be realistic

 You can pull out a weapon on the person mugging you, FearRP is very dumb.
