	<p>A new server has been made. </p>
	<br>
	<p>It is under active development and all suggestions are taken very seriously as of 1/11 . DarkRP server with idea of being free to play, packed with features while being lightweight for low-end pc's. A Server name lasting longer than 3 years with knowledgable management from the beginning. Our first server was a distaster, but we have learned the ways of server ownership since.</p>
