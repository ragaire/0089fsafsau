Do not under any circumstance, use any staff commands <mark>UNLESS within staffing situations.</mark> A Staffing situation is any time you are interfering “RP” to solve a rule break, or deal with a claim (When a player uses @ )


Spectating (Admin+) can not be used to your advantage. If you are spectating, please refrain from basing or engaging in RP. 


DO NOT Warn, Mute, Kick, Ban a player for “Staff Disrespect” unless the player is actively causing a fight in chat, or ruining other players time. 


Try to uphold a friendly environment in the server, Welcoming new players & accepting claims as they come. 

Staff members off-duty are can still be punished through normal staff guidelines

Punishments are down to your individual judgement. A General guideline for punishment is based off of the severity of the rule break. 


Any ban longer than 2 weeks is not permitted, as set by your banning limitations. If you need to request a permanent ban, contact any high level of staff.



You can use !votekick to your advantage, just as players can. If you are unsure of what punishment to do, this is a good alternative.


You can also use the default /arrest command to arrest a player (through the default DarkRP system) as a light punishment. 


DO NOT BAN FOR ANY CHAT-RELATED REASONS!!! 

DO NOT !BRING A PLAYER WITHOUT THEIR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE!!!

DO NOT REFUND PLAYERS WITHOUT PROOF!!!

DO NOT FIGHT OTHER STAFF MEMBERS!!!
<hr>

Usually a ban lasting longer than a day is un-neccesary unless a player is repeatadly coming back and breaking the rules.

I Will be using My STEAMID for the following examples. "STEAM_0:1:109002932" . As all commands are ran through chat, i highly recommend you use players steamid to prevent any accidental punishments happening to unsuspecting players. You can get someones steam id through logs, or through the scoreboard.
